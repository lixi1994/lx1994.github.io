<!-- ## About Me -->

<span style="color: red;">
I will be transitioning to a new phase in my academic career as an incoming Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science at the University of Alabama at Birmingham](https://www.uab.edu/cas/computerscience/){:target="_blank"}.
</span>

I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Penn State University under the guidance of [Dr. George Kesidis](https://www.cse.psu.edu/~gik2/){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. David Miller](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0AvzzVoAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}, with a dissertation on poisoning attacks and defenses for machine learning models.
I obtained my B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Southeast University in Nanjing, China, in 2016, and my M.S. degree in Computer Science from Penn State University in 2018.

## Research Interest 
<!-- ====== -->

My primary research interests focus on developing <strong>trustworthy and reliable AI systems</strong> to advance technology and address social challenges. I aim to ensure <strong>robustness, privacy, fairness, and interpretability of AI</strong> when applied across various domains.

![My Research Interest in Trustworthy AI](/images/future_research_overview.jpg)
> *My Research Interest in Trustworthy AI*

I'm currently exploring the following research topics:
* Robustness of large language models
* Responsibility of collaborative AI
* Trustworthy AI + X (Applications): Cybersecurity, Healthcare

<!-- I'm currently working on enhancing the robustness of foundation models and their integration into traditional machine learning systems. -->

<!-- My research interests include <strong>trustworthy AI</strong> and <strong>adversarial machine learning</strong>, with my Ph.D. thesis specifically focusing on poisoning attacks and defenses against deep neural networks. I'm currently working on enhancing the robustness of foundation models and their integration into traditional machine learning systems. -->

> *My Research Journey in Adversarial Machine Learning*

<!-- My research vision is centered on developing trustworthy and reliable AI systems, aiming to support the advancement of technology and solve social challenges. I am keen to broaden my research scope to encompass the concept of <strong>responsibility</strong> in machine learning, focusing on areas such as <strong>robustness, fairness, and interpritability</strong>. Recently, I'm exploring the following research topics: -->
<!-- * Robustness of large language models -->
<!-- * Equitable participation and collaborative learning in foundation model integrated machine learning frameworks. -->
<!-- * Responsibility (such as robustness and fairness) in multi-agent systems (collaborative AI) -->
<!-- * Trustworthy AI + X (Applications): Cybersecurity, Healthcare -->
