<!-- ## About Me -->

I'm currently a final-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Penn State University, supervised by [Dr. George Kesidis](https://www.cse.psu.edu/~gik2/){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. David Miller](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0AvzzVoAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}.


I received my M.S. degree from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Penn State University in 2018 and my B.E. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering at Southeast University (Nanjing, China) in 2016.

<span style="color: red;">
I will be transitioning to a new phase in my academic career as an incoming Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science at the University of Alabama at Birmingham](https://www.uab.edu/cas/computerscience/){:target="_blank"}.

## Research Interest and Vision
<!-- ====== -->

My research interests include <strong>trustworthy AI</strong> and <strong>adversarial machine learning</strong>, with my Ph.D. thesis specifically focusing on poisoning attacks and defenses against deep neural networks. I'm currently working on enhancing the robustness of foundation models and their integration into traditional machine learning systems.

> *My Research Journey in Adversarial Machine Learning*

My research vision is centered on developing trustworthy and reliable AI systems, aiming to support the advancement of technology and solve social challenges. I am keen to broaden my research scope to encompass the concept of <strong>responsibility</strong> in machine learning, focusing on areas such as <strong>robustness, fairness, and privacy</strong>. Recently, I'm exploring the following research topics:
* Robustness of large language models
* Equitable participation and collaborative learning in foundation model integrated machine learning frameworks.
* Robustness and fairness in multi-agent systems.
